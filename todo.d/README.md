# TODO fragments (`todo.d/`)

New tasks are **added** to `TODO.md` by dropping a small, uniquely-named
Markdown fragment in this directory. A scheduled job folds every fragment into
the `## 📥 Inbox` section of `TODO.md` and deletes the fragments it consumed.

This exists for the same reason [`changelog.d/`](../changelog.d/README.md) does:
many contributors and AI agents open PRs in parallel, and if every one of them
edited the same region of `TODO.md` directly, every PR would collide. A
fragment-per-task means no two PRs touch the same file, so there are no merge
conflicts on the TODO list.

> The changelog system uses the maintained OSS tool
> [`scriv`](https://scriv.readthedocs.io/). scriv is changelog-only and has no
> TODO equivalent, so assembly here is done by
> [`scripts/assemble_todo.py`](../scripts/assemble_todo.py). The fragment model
> is otherwise identical, deletion-on-collect included.

## Add a task

Create `todo.d/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>.md` — the date prefix is what makes
fragments sort chronologically, and the slug is what keeps two people adding a
task on the same day from colliding:

```markdown
- [ ] **TODO-PIN** Pin all reusable-workflow `uses:` refs to commit SHAs —
      several downstream repos pin a github-common SHA that no longer exists on
      `main`, so their super-linter job cannot resolve the workflow at all.
```

Copy [`templates/new_fragment.md`](templates/new_fragment.md) for a scaffold.
There is deliberately **no PR check** for TODO fragments (unlike changelog
fragments) — adding a task is optional, not something to enforce on every PR.

## Rules

- **Add-only.** Fragments _add_ tasks. Checking a task off, deleting it, or
  promoting it out of the Inbox into a curated section is a normal direct edit
  of `TODO.md` — those are low-collision and gain nothing from fragments.
- **One fragment per logical task** (or per tight cluster of related subtasks).
- Fragments are **exempt from the file-header rule** — do not add the
  `file`/`version`/`guid` header. The body is folded into `TODO.md` verbatim, so
  a header would leak into the assembled document. They are also excluded from
  markdownlint and prettier via `.markdownlintignore` / `.prettierignore`.
- A fragment that is **entirely HTML comments** is treated as an intentional
  no-op: it is deleted on collect without contributing anything. Comment out a
  fragment rather than deleting it if you want the collector to drop it quietly.

## How assembly works

- [`scripts/assemble_todo.py`](../scripts/assemble_todo.py) inserts every
  fragment body directly below the `<!-- todo-insert-here -->` marker in
  `TODO.md`, bumps that file's `version:` header, and `git rm`s the consumed
  fragments so the insertion and removals land in one commit.
- [`.github/workflows/todo-collect.yml`](../.github/workflows/todo-collect.yml)
  runs it daily and on `workflow_dispatch`, committing with `[skip ci]`.
- Configuration lives in [`todo.ini`](todo.ini). **That file's presence is what
  opts a repository in** — the assembler and the workflow both self-skip when it
  is absent, so the workflow is harmless in a repo that has not adopted this.

Run it yourself to preview:

```bash
python3 scripts/assemble_todo.py --dry-run   # print the result, change nothing
python3 scripts/assemble_todo.py --check     # exit 1 if fragments are pending
```
