# Changelog fragments (`changelog.d/`)

`CHANGELOG.md` is **assembled** from the fragment files in this directory — you
do **not** edit `CHANGELOG.md` by hand. Every change that is worth recording
drops a small, uniquely-named Markdown fragment here instead. At release time
the automation folds all fragments into a new dated section of `CHANGELOG.md`
and deletes them.

This exists because many contributors and AI agents open PRs in parallel. If
everyone edited the single `## [Unreleased]` block in `CHANGELOG.md` directly,
every PR would collide. A fragment-per-change means PRs never touch the same
file, so there are no changelog merge conflicts.

> This is a focused revival of the retired JSON "doc-update" system, using the
> maintained open-source [`scriv`](https://scriv.readthedocs.io/) tool instead
> of bespoke scripts.

## Add a fragment

```bash
pip install scriv           # first time only
scriv create                # writes changelog.d/<timestamp>_<branch>.md
```

Open the generated file, uncomment the section(s) that apply, and fill them in.
You can also just create the file by hand following the format below. A CI check
fails any PR that changes code without adding a fragment.

## Format

A fragment is a slice of Markdown grouped under Keep a Changelog category
headings. Give each entry a `####` title and a short explanatory paragraph — a
changelog carries **more detail than a release note**: what changed, why, and
any impact or reproduction.

```markdown
### Fixed

#### Short imperative title for the change

A detailed explanation of the change: what it does, why it was needed, and any
impact or reproduction detail worth recording.
```

- **Categories:** `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`,
  `Security` (Keep a Changelog).
- **Conventional-commit → category:** `feat` → Added, `fix` → Fixed,
  `perf`/`refactor` → Changed; deprecations → Deprecated, removals → Removed,
  security fixes → Security.
- One fragment per logical change. Use several category sections in one fragment
  only when a single change genuinely spans them.
- Fragments are **exempt from the file-header rule** — do not add the
  `file`/`version`/`guid` header (it would leak into `CHANGELOG.md`).

## How assembly works

- `scriv collect --version <tag>` (run by `.github/workflows/changelog-collect.yml`
  when a release is published) inserts a new `## <version> — <date>` section at
  the `<!-- scriv-insert-here -->` marker in `CHANGELOG.md`, grouped by category,
  and removes the collected fragments.
- The PR fragment check comes from `.github/workflows/changelog-check.yml`.
- Configuration lives in [`scriv.ini`](scriv.ini); the new-fragment scaffold is
  [`templates/new_fragment.md.j2`](templates/new_fragment.md.j2).
- GitHub **release notes** stay commit-based; this detailed changelog is the
  separate, richer artifact.
